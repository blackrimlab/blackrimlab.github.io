I am pleased to announce that the lab is advertising for a postdoctoral position related to the phylogenomics and evolution of the Ericales plant clade. The position has funding for two years. We are looking to have someone start by the beginning of the year 2020 if possible though there is some flexibility.

Our project, working with the University of Florida, is to collect, sequence, and analyze hundreds of transcriptomes of Ericales along with thousands of targeted capture sequences (we will assist UoF with this). Once these are collected we are interested in answering questions about the evolution of the group between temperate and tropical areas and how morphological evolution intersects with these movements. Position duties include managing the sequencing of transcriptomes and the analysis once the data come back. There will be opportunities to train undergrads and grads as well as direct involvement in project planning. There are also opportunities to help develop, plan, and teach a bilingual workshop on phylogenetics and genomics. 

Qualifications include a PhD in biological sciences, preferably with a focus on ecology and on organismal and evolutionary biology. In addition, expertise in laboratory work, organization and analysis of diverse datatypes, and interests in large scale questions regarding the evolution of flowering plants. 

The Smith lab is a diverse bunch of folks that range in interests from plant evolution to computational biology. There are great opportunities for interaction and collaboration for those interested. The University of Michigan also has great resources for professional development. 

If you are interested or have any questions, please send your CV and information for references (eebsmith@umich.edu). 

Review of applications will begin immediately.
