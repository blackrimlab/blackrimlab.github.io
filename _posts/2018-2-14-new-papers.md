A couple of our papers just came out in the Tree of Life special edition of AJB. [Pease et al. *Quartet Sampling distinguishes lack of support from conflicting support in the green plant tree of life* ](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajb2.1016/abstract) looks at different ways to examine support in a phylogeny using a bunch of green plant examples. [Smith and Brown *Constructing a broadly inclusive seed plant phylogeny*](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajb2.1019/abstract) uses OpenTreeOfLife and GenBank to make a big dated seed plant phylogeny.
