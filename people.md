Welcome to the Smith lab! In the picture on the right, we actually have most of the grad students, postdocs, and visitors in the lab in one picture (with the exception of Hector - sorry Hector!).

## PI: Stephen A. Smith
![blackrim as pixel art](/assets/img/pixel_me.png){:style="float: right;margin-left: 7px;margin-bottom: 7px; width: 120px;"}
I work on questions related to plant evolution, detecting and describing large scale patterns of evolution, examining differences in the rate of molecular evolution, morphological evolution, genomics, and geography. A great deal of this involves the development of new methods and new computational tools. More information on projects related to these topics can be found on the projects page. My faculty page is [here](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/faculty/eebsmith.html). You can get my cv [here](assets/cv.pdf).
